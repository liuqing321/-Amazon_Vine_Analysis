# -Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. The purpose of this project is to find out whether there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the selected data set. Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program will be analyzed in this project.
