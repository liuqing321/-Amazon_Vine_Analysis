# -Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. The purpose of this project is to find out whether there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the selected data set. Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program will be analyzed in this project.

## Summary 

Only few customers have Vine membership, so the impact of vine-program on video games' five-star review is very small. The five-star reviews from Vine memebers only account for 0.1% of the total helpful reviews. The reviews from other customers account for 38.70% of the total helpful reviews.  In all the five-star reviews, the reviews from Vine member only account for 0.3% of the total five-star reviews while the five-star reviews from other customers account for 99.7% of the total five-star reviews. 

However, when compare the ratio of five-star reviews in different customer groups, we can see that the five-star review rate for the customers with Vine membership is apparently higher than the five-star review rate for the customers without Vine membership.

In sum, there is positive bias for reviews in the Vine program. Because Amazon Vine members are more likely to provide five-star reviews. But the bias would not seriously affect the entire review for one product since only a small amount of customers participated in Vine program.
